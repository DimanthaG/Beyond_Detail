# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **@reach/router Conflict**: Removed `@reach/router@^1.3.4` which requires React 16 but you have React 18. You're already using React Router v6, so this package was redundant.

2. **Vercel Configuration**: Added `vercel.json` to properly configure the build:
   - Specifies build command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
   - Points to correct output directory: `frontend_beyond_detail/build`
   - Framework: React

3. **Root package.json**: Updated to define workspace structure and build scripts for both frontend and backend

4. **npm Configuration**: Added `.npmrc` to standardize npm behavior with `legacy-peer-deps=true`

## What Changed

- **Removed**: `@reach/router` dependency from `frontend_beyond_detail/package.json`
- **Added**: `vercel.json` configuration file
- **Updated**: Root `package.json` with workspace and build scripts
- **Added**: `.npmrc` for npm optimization

## Vercel Build Process

When you push to GitHub, Vercel will now:
1. Detect the `vercel.json` file
2. Run: `cd frontend_beyond_detail && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
3. Deploy the generated `build/` folder

## npm install

If you still need to install locally, run:
```bash
cd frontend_beyond_detail
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts, which is safe in your case since all packages are compatible with React 18.

## Testing Locally

```bash
cd frontend_beyond_detail
npm start
```

This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000
