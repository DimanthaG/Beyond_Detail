## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN

All new pages are fully responsive:
- Mobile: Single column layouts, touch-friendly buttons
- Tablet: 2-column grids
- Desktop: Full featured layouts with 3+ columns

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT NOTES

1. **Sanity CMS**: No deployment needed, schemas are live once file is updated
2. **Frontend**: Run `npm start` to test locally
3. **Production**: Run `npm run build` and deploy to hosting

---

## 💾 BACKUP & SAFETY

- All existing routes and pages remain unchanged
- New schemas don't affect existing Sanity documents
- No breaking changes to existing components
- Safe to deploy incrementally

---

## 📞 QUICK SUPPORT

If pages don't load:
1. Check Sanity CMS has documents created
2. Verify Sanity client configuration in `src/client.js`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure document type names match schema names exactly

If styling looks off:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Check SCSS files are in correct directories
3. Verify npm start is running
